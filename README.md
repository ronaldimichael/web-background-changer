# Web Background Changer

## Project Description

**Web Background Changer** is a simple web-based project created to practice and implement fundamental JavaScript concepts. The main purpose of this project is to apply the JavaScript knowledge I learned from the **WPU (Web Programming UNPAS)** YouTube channel into a real and functional application (https://youtu.be/DLFqQ1SP8xU).

This project focuses on core JavaScript topics such as:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Functions and parameters
- Dynamic value generation using JavaScript

By building this project, I improved my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, as well as how user interactions can dynamically change the appearance of a web page. This project serves as a hands-on learning exercise and a foundation for more advanced JavaScript development.
