# Web Background Changer

## Overview
**Web Background Changer** is a simple front-end project built to practice core JavaScript concepts related to DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic styling. This project was created as part of my self-learning process using the **WPU (Web Programming UNPAS)** YouTube channel.

The application allows users to change the background color of the webpage using buttons, sliders, and JavaScript-generated values.

## Learning Objectives
The main goal of this project is to understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS through user events and dynamic DOM updates.

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Handle user interactions using event listeners
- Dynamically change styles using JavaScript
- Manipulate the DOM by creating, selecting, and modifying elements
- Use JavaScript math functions to generate dynamic values

## JavaScript Concepts Implemented

### DOM Selection
- `getElementById`
- `getElementsByTagName`
- `getElementsByClassName`
- `querySelector`

### DOM Manipulation
- `createElement`
- `createTextNode`
- `append`
- `classList.toggle`
- `setAttribute`

### Event Handling
- `addEventListener`
- Mouse events (`click`, `mousedown`, `input`)
- Callback functions
- Event object usage (`event.clientX`, `event.clientY`)

### JavaScript Math
- `Math.random`
- `Math.round`
- `Math.floor`
